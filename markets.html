          Rotherham Markets
        </h1>
        <p>
          Rotherham has been a market town for over 800 years when it’s original
          Royal Market Charter was granted by King John in 1207.In many ways
          it's Rotherham Market that gives the town centre its unique
          atmosphere, creating a refreshing change from traditional high street
          shopping.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, ambitious regeneration and improvement plans are currently
          under development, in a new era for the popular indoor market.
        </p>
        <p>
          The regeneration of Rotherham markets is identiﬁed as a key project
          within Rotherham Council’s Town Centre Masterplan, and supports the
          Council's Future High Street Fund bid. Rotherham is one of the
          shortlisted areas that will receive up to £150,000 of new funding to
          work up a detailed bid for town centre improvements.
