          Parking in Rotherham
        </h1>
        <p>
          Whether you live, work or shop in Rotherham, there are a number of
          very reasonably priced Council car parks and on street parking
          locations within the town centre, with free options also available.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Council operates 1,250 off-street parking and 360 on-street
          parking bays across the town centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of Rotherham’s car parks are on the edge of the town centre, with
          just a short walk to the main facilities. This includes parking
          directly opposite the markets (Drummond Street), parking on Forge
          Island, in Wellgate Multi-Story, and Corporation Street (Scala Car
          Park) which is located between the bus station and train station.
        </p>

        <p>
          Work on the Forge Island development will start in 2020/2021 and it is
          expected that half the site will be retained for parking whilst the
          development progresses, with a 360-space undercroft facility once the
          leisure development in complete.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prices start from as little as 50p for 30 minutes’ parking, £1.20 for
          one hour, £2.40 for two hours and £3.50 for all day parking.
