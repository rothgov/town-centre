          Rotherham Town Centre Story
        </h1>
        <p>
          Rotherham town centre has, for hundreds years, been a place for people
          to come together, meet, and be a community.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, town centres are changing. No longer, can they rely on the
          traditional pull of retail to bring people together in this way.
        </p>

        <p>
          If these traditional meeting places are to survive, they must evolve,
          and this is what we hope to capture in this “story” for the future of
          Rotherham town centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a proud market town, one of the key parts of this vision, will be
          to have a market that the town is even more proud of.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it doesn’t end there, the town centre needs to become a place that
          people will visit in order to have fun, to socialise, live and work.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want the town centre to be a place where people will be happy to
          bring their families, to a vibrant, diverse, and thriving community.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most exciting pieces of this transformation will be the
          opportunity to live in the town centre - in aspirational, waterfront
          developments and eco-friendly dwellings. This introduction of 'homes'
          to the town centre will bring with it the energy that only comes from
          a lived-in space that is fully utilised, fully working - and fully
          loved.
        </p>

        <p>
          Part of this vision includes bringing back some of the things that
          were so loved in the past about town centres.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tram train is already operational, we will soon have a fantastic
          new cinema and there will be more great places to eat and drink.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the work on the public realm will mean there are clean, safe and
          attractive spaces for people to enjoy in the town centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of this will be more accessible than ever to residents across the
          borough, because of improved cycle lanes, canal side walking routes,
          better public transport and an infrastructure for sustainable
          transport.
        </p>

        <p>
          We want residents to care, to contribute to and to be a part of this
          journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result will be that Rotherham town centre comes alive once more.
