          Rotherham Town Centre Masterplan
        </h1>
        <p>
          The Rotherham Town Centre Masterplan sets out an exciting number of
          developments that will transform and revitalise the town centre, with
          a vibrant leisure scheme on Forge Island, attractive outdoor spaces,
          revitalised markets complex and high quality riverside and urban
          living.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan is bold but it is also realistic. The opportunities for
          growth and regeneration have been identified and are translating into
          key projects which can bring about transformational change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rotherham Council is taking a pro-active approach to developing the
          town centre. Through its various activities including use of public
          landholdings, through direct investment, through the facilitation of
          government funding, through partnerships with the private sector and
          through planning powers, Rotherham Council is working tirelessly to
          see the plan delivered.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Masterplan focusses on developing the economic vitality of
          Rotherham town centre, and aims to bring more life, activity and
          spending back into the town centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of the Masterplan is an improved visitor experience
          utilising the attractive waterside location, improved and additional
          public spaces and feature buildings, and providing new places to eat,
          drink, shop and visit. The Forge Island development will include a new
          cinema, hotel, restaurants whilst the residential project will mirror
          efforts being made to improve the leisure offer, bringing housing to
          three key disused sites, and more people living in the town centre.
