          Town Centre Housing
        </h1>
        <p>
          Around 170 new homes will be built in a £30 million investment, breathing new life into town centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          The provision of new home has been identified as a key regeneration priority in the Town Centre Masterplan.
        </p>

        <p>
          The developments include a mixture of council homes for rent, shared ownership and private properties for sale:
        </p>

        <ul class="lh-copy">
          <li>Sheffield Road car park – 78 homes (44 Council, 34 private)</li>
          <li>Millfold House – 39 homes (25 Council, 14 private)</li>
          <li> Former Henley’s Garage, Wellgate – 54 homes (23 Council, 31 shared ownership)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The three sites are all in prime, central location and are adjacent to land with potential for further housing development.
        </p>

        <p>
          A high proportion of the properties will be affordable homes. Working  with construction partner, Wilmot Dixon Construction Ltd, work will start on the sites in 2020, with the first homes available by the Spring of 2021 and the entire scheme complete by early 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
          Councillor Dominic Beck, Cabinet Member for Housing at Rotherham Council, said: "It will totally transform three disused former industrial sites and kick-start a raft of new housing development in the town centre.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The developments include a variety of property types to suit people of different ages including first-time buyers, key workers, families and older downsizers. There will also be a block of 23 Council-rented apartments on the former Henley's Garage site which will be age-banded for applicants of over 50 years of age."
