        <p>
          Rotherham College, based in the heart of the Town Centre, works in
          partnership with RNN Training to deliver an exciting range of
          apprenticeships.
        </p>

        <p>
          On an apprenticeship you'll work towards a nationally recognised
          qualification whilst spending the majority of your time in a workplace
          gaining the sought-after experience that employers want.
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll feel the rewards in your pocket too. You will earn a wage and
          have some of the same benefits as full-time members of staff,
          including holiday pay.
        </p>

        <p>
          As an apprentice, you will be employed by a company while you learn,
          working alongside experienced staff to gain job specific skills. You
          will build up experience, knowledge and skills that will help you to
          work towards achieving a nationally recognised qualification.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your employer will pay you a wage and support you through your
          training and you will be assessed within your place of work. You will
          also have to gain a technical certificate or other qualifications,
          which you can study at college on day release or block release. There
          are also some apprenticeships which can now be studied entirely in the
          workplace.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will have a dedicated assessor to support you through your
          apprenticeship, which will last from 18 months or up to four years
          depending on the industry, level of course and your own abilities.
