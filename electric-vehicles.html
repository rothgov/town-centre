          Electric Vehicles
        </h1>
        <p>
          In a bid to attract new users of electric vehicles and early users of
          charging points, Rotherham Council is making electric vehicle charging
          available for free until the end of the financial year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Until the end of March 2020, electric car owners will be able to
          charge their vehicles for free at all Rotherham Council owned charging
          points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2015, Rotherham Council has been installing charging points in
          car parks throughout the borough. The new charging points came from a
          series of government grants as a way to improve air quality and reach
          climate change targets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Normally, users will require a membership charge card or smartphone
          app to operate them, through which they can pay for their charges.
          Charges for parking in the car parks still apply.
        </p>

        <p>
          Electric vehicle numbers are on the rise and they are providing a
          cheaper and cleaner alternative to traditional cars.
        </p>

        <p>
          Per mile, electric cars are an average of 13.9p cheaper to run than
          their petrol counterparts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rotherham Council’s cabinet member for Jobs & the Local Economy,
          Councillor Denise Lelliott, said:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “There are many benefits to owning an electric car including lower
            running costs and no road tax. The introduction of more charging
            points across the borough will make it easier to charge your vehicle
            in the future, with the added benefit of free charging until March
            2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The charging points are part of the Council’s continued investment
            into our communities, and supports our ongoing commitment to reduce
            emissions. Electric cars are more sustainable and less polluting
            alternative, particularly compared with diesel cars.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
