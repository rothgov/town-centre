          A new leisure destination within the heart of Rotherham, Forge Island is a key development in the Town Centre Masterplan, occupying a prominent river and canal side site on the edge of the Town Centre.

          Forge Island maximises its waterside location and the development will bring a cinema, hotel, restaurants and bars, as well as modern residential opportunities and attractive public realm connecting to the wider town centre. The cinema partner will be announced in early 2020.
