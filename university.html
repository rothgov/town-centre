          University Centre Rotherham
        </h1>
        <p>
          The University Centre Rotherham (UCR) is a £10.5 million new facility
          for students and adult learners in the heart of Rotherham.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose-built centre on Doncaster Gate provides access to degrees
          and higher-level qualifications, accredited by Hull University and
          Sheffield Hallam University. Degrees are more accessible for people in
          the town with tuition fees under the £9,000 charged by many
          universities.
        </p>

        <p>
          UCR is operated by leading education and training provider RNN Group.
          Courses cover digital, creative, health, technical construction,
          engineering, and leadership and management, to meet the needs of the
          local economy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other courses include business enterprise, graphic design,
          performance, education, computing, media and photography. The 3,300m²
          campus houses a range of dedicated facilities including seminar and
          lecture rooms, independent group study spaces, a fully-equipped
          library, a café and exhibition spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Studying at UCR means students can achieve their career aspirations
          without the need to live away from home or travel long distances and
          offers opportunities for those already in employment who want to study
          a degree or higher-level qualification around their work and family
          commitments.
        </p>

        <p>
          The centre aims to develop both education and business for future
          generations in Rotherham. It plays a pivotal role in closing the
          skills gap in the town and supports the local economy by increasing
          access to higher-level skills, inspiring students to become the
          business leaders and entrepreneurs of the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          The UCR development was part-funded by the Sheffield City Region which
          contributed £3.5m of Local Growth Fund money.
