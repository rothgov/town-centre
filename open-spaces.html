        <p>
          At the heart of the town centre, overlooked by Rotherham Minster,
          Minster Gardens with its Heart of Steel it’s the perfect place to sit
          with a cup of coffee and the morning paper. The gardens have space for
          open-air events, lawns and a meadow area. It also features the
          original foundation stones from Rotherham’s market hall as seating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearby, you will find All Saints’ Square, with its water feature and
          surrounding shops. A little further afield, on the edge of the town
          centre, is Clifton Park, covering 54 acres and featuring a splash
          park, small woodland, museum and theme park.
